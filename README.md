# CWE-Bench-Java

This repository contains the dataset CWE-Bench-Java presented in the paper [LLM-Assisted Static Analysis for Detecting Security Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17238).
At a high level, this dataset contains 120 CVEs spanning 4 CWEs, namely path-traversal, OS-command injection, cross-site scripting, and code-injection.
Each CVE includes the buggy and fixed source code of the project, along with the information of the fixed files and functions.
We provide the seed information in this repository, and we provide scripts for fetching, patching, and building the repositories.
The dataset collection process is illustrated in the figure below:

CWE-Bench is now primarily hosted at the [data directory of the IRIS repo.](https://github.com/iris-sast/iris/tree/v2/data)

[CWE-Bench-Java on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/iris-sast/CWE-Bench-Java) - The dataset is also available to use with the Hugging Face datasets library.

## Project Identifier

In this dataset, each project is uniquely identified with a **Project Slug**, encompassing its repository name, CVE ID, and a tag corresponding to the buggy version of the project.
We show one example below:

```
DSpace__DSpace_CVE-2016-10726_4.4
^^^^^^  ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^
|       |      |              |--> Version Tag
|       |      |--> CVE ID
|       |--> Repository name
|--> Github Username
```

All the patches, advisory information, build information, and fix information are associated with project slugs.
Since there are 120 projects in the CWE-Bench-Java dataset, we have 120 unique project slugs.
Note that a single repository may be found to have different CVEs in different versions.

## Packaged Data

```
- data/
  - project_info.csv
  - build_info.csv
  - fix_info.csv
- patches/<project_slug>.patch
- advisory/<project_slug>.json
```

The core set of information in this dataset lies in two files, `data/project_info.csv` and `data/fix_info.csv`.
We also provide other essential information such as CVE advisory, build information, and patches for the projects to be compiled and built.
We now go into the project information and fix information CSVs.

### Project Info

| id | project_slug | cve_id | cwe_id | cwe_name | github_username | github_repository_name | github_tag | github_url | advisory_id | buggy_commit_id | fix_commit_ids |
| -- | ------------ | ------ | -------|----------|-----------------|------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | DSpace__DSpace_CVE-2016-10726_4.4 | CVE-2016-10726 | CWE-022 | Path Traversal | DSpace | DSpace | 4.4 | https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace | GHSA-4m9r-5gqp-7j82 | ca4c86b1baa4e0b07975b1da86a34a6e7170b3b7 | 4239abd2dd2ae0dedd7edc95a5c9f264fdcf639d |

Each row in `data/project_info.csv` looks like the example above.
We now get into each field and explain what they are.

- `id`: an integer from 1 to 120
- `project_slug`: (explained in the previous section)
- `cve_id`: a common vulnerability identifier `CVE-XXXX-XXXXX`
- `cwe_id`: a common weakness enumeration (CWE) identifier. In our dataset, there is only `CWE-022`, `CWE-078`, `CWE-079`, `CWE-094`
- `cwe_name`: the name of the CWE
- `github_username`: the user/organization that owns the repository on Github
- `github_repository_name`: the repository name on Github
- `github_tag`: the tag associated with the version where the vulnerability is found; usually a version tag
- `github_url`: the URL to the github repository
- `advisory_id`: the advisory ID in Github Security Advisory database
- `buggy_commit_id`: the commit hash (like `ca4c86b1baa4e0b07975b1da86a34a6e7170b3b7`) where the vulnerability can be reproduced
- `fix_commit_ids`: the set of commit hashes (sequentially ordered and separated with semicolon `;`) corresponding to the fix of the vulnerability

### Fix Info

The `data/fix_info.csv` file contains the fixed Java methods and classes to each CVE.
In general, the fix could span over multiple commits, and a change could be made to arbitrary files in the repository, including resources (like `.txt`, `.html`) and Java source files (including core source code and test cases).
In this table, we only include the methods and classes that are considered core.
Many of the rows in this table is manually vetted and labeled.
Note that there may be fixes on class variables, in which case there will not be method information associated with the fix.
A single function may be "fixed" by multiple commits.

Each row in `data/fix_info.csv` looks like the following.

| project_slug | cve | github_username | github_repository_name | commit | file | class | class_start | class_end | method | method_start | method_end | signature |
|--------------|-----|-----------------|------------------------|--------|------|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| apache__activemq_CVE-2014-3576_5.10.1 | CVE-2014-3576 | apache | activemq | `f07e6a53216f9388185ac2b39f366f3bfd6a8a55` | `activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/TransportConnection.java` | `TransportConnection` | 104 | 1654 | `processControlCommand` | 1536 | 1538 | `Response processControlCommand(ControlCommand)` |

- `project_slug`: the unique identifier of each project
- `cve_id`: the CVE id
- `github_username`: the user/organization that owns the repository on Github
- `github_repository_name`: the repository name on Github
- `commit`: the commit hash containing this fix
- `file`: the `.java` file that is fixed
- `class`: the name of the class that is fixed
- `class_start`, `class_end`: the start and end line number of the class
- `method`: the name of the method that is fixed
- `method_start`, `method_end`: the start and end line number of the method
- `signature`: the signature of the method. Note that we might have multiple overloaded methods with the same name but with different signatures

## Fetch and Build Projects

We provide the scripts to fetch, patch, and build projects, assuming that you have a machine with any distribution of Linux x64.
In order to run the scripts, make sure that you have plenty of space on the host machine (as many projects can be very large).
Fetching repository requires that you have `git`, `wget`, `zip`/`unzip`, `tar`, and `python3` available on your system.

For building, we need Java distributions as well as Maven and Gradle for package management.
In case you have a different system than Linux x64, please modify `scripts/jdk_version.json`, `scripts/mvn_version.json`, and `scripts/gradle_version.json` to specify the corresponding JDK/MVN/Gradle files.
In addition, please prepare 3 versions of JDK and put them under the `java-env` folder.
This is due to that Oracle requires an account to download JDK, and we are unable to provide an automated script.
Download from the following URLs:

- JDK 7u80: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase7-archive-downloads.html
- JDK 8u202: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html
- JDK 17: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html

At this point, you should have a `java-env` directory that looks like

```
- java-env/
  - jdk-7u80-linux-x64.tar.gz
  - jdk-8u202-linux-x64.tar.gz
  - jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
```

Now, you can run our script using the command:

``` bash
$ python3 scripts/setup.py
```

This script will do the following things

- Create `build-info` and `project-sources` directories
- Install multiple JDK versions by unzipping your provided JDK distributions (in `java-env`)
- Install multiple MAVEN versions by automatically downloading and unzipping the MAVEN distributions (in `java-env`)
- Install multiple Gradle versions by automatically downloading and unzipping the Gradle distributions (in `java-env`)
- For each project in our dataset
  - Fetch the project into `project-sources/<project_slug>` directory
  - Build the project by trying multiple versions of JDK and MAVEN. The build information (whether it succeed or not) will be stored to `build-info/`

The resulting build information will be stored under `build-info` directory.
Each file is a `.json` storing content like the following that specifies the corresponding Java version and the used Maven/Gradle/Gradlew versions.

``` json
{"jdk": "8u202", "mvn": "3.5.0"}
```

### Fetch without building

For those of you who do not want to build, you do not need to provide the JDK distributions.
Just directly run the following command:

``` bash
$ python3 scripts/setup.py --no-build
```

### Only fetch/build a subset of projects

You can use the following arguments (or a combination of them) to specify the set of projects you want to build.
For `--filter` and `--exclude`, we will use the specified names to match against project slugs.
Here is a few examples:

``` bash
$ python3 scripts/setup.py --cwe CWE-022 CWE-078   # only builds projects under CWE-022 and CWE-078
$ python3 scripts/setup.py --filter keycloak       # only build keycloak projects (there are multiple of them)
$ python3 scripts/setup.py --exclude apache        # do not build any apache related projects
```

### Build Information

After building attempts, results will be output to the `build-info/` directory as well as the `data/build_info.csv`.
Specifically, `build-info/` directory contains individual JSON files for each project; `data/build_info.csv` contains a full CSV table for all the projects.
Each row in `data/build_info.csv` consists of the following:

| project_slug | status | jdk_version | mvn_version | gradle_version | use_gradlew |
|--------------|--------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| perwendel__spark_CVE-2018-9159_2.7.1 | success | 8u202 | 3.5.0 | n/a | n/a |

- `project_slug`: the identifier of the project
- `status`: either `success` or `failure` indicating whether the project has been successfully built
- `jdk_version`: if built successfully, the JDK version used. May be `7u80`, `8u202`, or `17`
- `mvn_version`: if built successfully with MAVEN, the MAVEN version used. Maybe 3.5.0 or 3.9.8. If not built successful or not built with MAVEN, it will be `n/a`
- `gradle_version`: if built successfully with Gradle, the Gradle version used. Otherwise, it will be `n/a`
- `use_gradlew`: if built successfully with the custom `gradlew` script provided with the project itself, it will be `1`. Otherwise it will be `n/a`

## Visualization

We provide a simple website that helps visualize the CVEs and provide necessary pointers to details of the CVEs provided in the dataset.
You can start a simple Python http server by running the following script in your terminal:

``` bash
$ python3 -m http.server
```

Then you can visit the webpage in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/visualization/index.html`.
If all the projects are fetched properly, you should see the following interface in your browser:

![visualization](resources/visualizer-screenshot.png)

As shown in the screenshot, you will be able to navigate to the corresponding Github repository, an NVD advisory page, and look at the files and diffs related to the fix of the vulnerability.
All the links are clickable and take you straight to the source in Github.
The visualization page also provides functionalities to search and filter projects by CWEs, which should come in handy when you need to closely investigate the vulnerabilities.

Newly added CVEs, if well-formatted according to `data/build_info.csv` and `data/fix_info.csv`, will
be automatically displayed within the visualizer.
